      "desc":"The Cariboo economic region is the third largest development region in the province, encompassing 131,286 square kilometres of land in the northern interior of the province. It spans from the Cariboo plateau in the west to the valleys of the Cariboo and Rocky Mountain ranges. It includes the city of Prince George, which acts as a major service centre for the northern half of the province. Just over 6% of the region's 153,800 residents are First Nations. The Cariboo region is characterized by vast forests, rivers, lakes, mountains, and interior plateau lands between the Coast Mountains and the Rockies. The region is comprised of the traditional territories of a number of interior First Nations: The Secwepemc and Stl'atl'imx in the south-central part of the region, the Tsilhqot'in in the region's east, and the Dakelh in the north towards Prince George and beyond.",
      "bgd":"Since time immemorial, the inhabitants of the Cariboo region maintained a sustainable socioeconomic system using the rich and varied abundance of natural resources of the region. Fishing in the Cariboo's many rivers and lakes historically played a large economic role, and today recreational and sport fishing remain important, both culturally and economically. In the 1860s, a gold rush descended on the Cariboo region, bringing prospectors from across North America eager to make their fortunes. Other entrepreneurs soon moved to the area to service the growing boomtowns. Today, resource-based industries such as mining and forestry, as well as spin-off support industries like lumber processing and trucking, continue to play a strong role in the area's economy.",
      "sum":"With a greater population than its northern neighboring regions (North Coast, Nechako and Northeast), the Cariboo regional economy is comparatively larger in sectors such as health care professional services, administration and manufacturing, while still being based primarily in the natural-resources sector.  The rich forestry and mining resources that formed the basis of the early settler economy continue to play dominant roles, supporting Prince George as a service and supply hub for natural resource and construction activities. The boom-and-bust nature of these industries, impacted by fluctuating commodities prices, as well as natural disturbances like the Pine Beetle infestation, have contributed to a higher degree of economic instability in the region compared to the province's more diverse southern economies. Cariboo's closer proximity to southern British Columbia has enabled growth of the outdoor recreation economy, including fishing, boating, hiking and biking in the summer months and skiing and snowmobiling in the winter.",

Largely rural in nature, the region extends from Radium Hot Springs in the north to the US border in the south, and from the city of Greenwood in the west across the Monashee, Selkirk, and Purcell Mountains to the Municipality of Sparwood in the Rocky Mountains to the east. Cranbrook is the largest population and commercial centre in the region. Approximately 1% of the region's 148,300 residents are First Nations. The pristine rivers, lakes, waterfalls, beaches, mineral hot springs, alpine meadows and snow-capped mountains of the Kootenay region are primarily the traditional territory of the Ktunaxa ethnic group, who have inhabited the area (as well as parts of modern-day Montana, Washington and Idaho) since time immemorial. It is the Ktunaxa after whom the region draws its name. The Ktunaxa are linguistically distinct from other First Nations. The western stretches of the Kootenay region are also considered traditional Okanagan and Secwepemc territory.",
      "bgd":"The traditional Kootenay economy revolved around seasonal use of the diverse natural resources in the region. The Kootenay River served as a transportation artery and food source, as well as a primary site for many Ktunaxa villages. Like much of the rest of British Columbia, the settler economy brought unprecedented development of the natural resources sector, with timber harvesting becoming the region's first commercial industry in the mid 1800's. Coal was discovered in the late 1800's; mining began before the turn of the 20th century and now, along with the extraction of other minerals, makes up a significant portion of the regional economy. Today, the Kootenay economy also includes tourism and outdoor recreation, with numerous restored heritage towns, as well as vibrant arts and cultural events.",
      "sum":"Today, the main pillars of the Kootenay regional economy continue to be tourism, mining, and forestry, with much of regional employment existing directly in, or in support of these three sectors. Coal extraction from multiple mines in the region's Elk Valley\u2014 home to the largest coalfields in the province\u2014 continues to provide significant employment. A progressive Impact Management Benefits Agreement has been signed between the communities of the Ktunaxa Nation and Teck Resources, a primary mining proponent in the area. Lumber and pulp production continue to be important industries throughout the region. Towards the southern regional boundary, zinc and lead smelting and refining, as well as wood products manufacturing play key roles. A spectrum of all-season recreation, tourism, and cultural activities and amenities throughout the region make tourism a year-round income generator.",

It includes the Greater Vancouver area, the Fraser Valley and the Sunshine Coast, and stretches north to include Whistler, Pemberton and Lillooet. While it is one of British Columbia's smallest regions in terms of land area, it is home to over 60% of the provincial population, and serves as B.C.'s principal economic hub. While the Mainland Southwest has the third highest First Nations population (24,475) of the eight regions, this makes up the smallest percentage, at 0.84% of the region's 2.9 million inhabitants. The region's mountains, oceans, lakes, inlets, beaches, the Fraser River plain and delta, and lands surrounding the Salish Sea (Georgia Strait) make up the traditional territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. The Coast Salish peoples are a vast and diverse network of culturally and linguistically linked individual communities that comprise one of the largest indigenous cultural groups in British Columbia.",
      "bgd":"The large pre-European Coast Salish population numbered in the tens of thousands and was organized into sophisticated socio-economic structures, with many distinct communities and linguistic dialects. Communities existed along the Fraser River valley, in the present day city of Vancouver and in the surrounding mountainous mainland north to Bute Inlet. The Coast Salish also inhabited the Gulf Islands, the southern area of Vancouver Island including the City of Victoria and into modern-day United States along the coast of Washington and Oregon. The Fraser River served as a major transportation artery, and its salmon run provided one of the largest single sources of food in the region. The relatively flat and fertile lands of the Fraser delta allowed for plentiful natural crops. The highly habitable and naturally productive capacity of the region supported the large pre-colonial population and economy; it is because of these characteristics that the Mainland Southwest became the colonial economic and population centre as well. Initial economic drivers in the Lower Mainland Southwest were, like much of the rest of the province, initially the fur trade, then forestry and mining. Quickly, trade, finance, and manufacturing sectors emerged to manage and support the new colonial economy, and a rapidly growing population gave rise to service, health, and education sectors throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The 1990's and 2000's also saw a strong technology sector emerge in the Mainland Southwest.",
      "sum":"With Vancouver serving as Canada's primary trade gateway to Asia, the trade and financial services sectors today are dominant parts of the regional economy. Healthcare and social assistance, as well as professional, scientific and technical services, are also dominant sectors in terms of employment numbers. There has also been significant growth in the information, culture, and recreation sector. Transportation, education, secondary manufacturing, and agriculture continue to be core economic pillars. In the area of the mainland that lies directly north of Metro Vancouver, logging and mining continue to play an important role, though proportionally a much smaller one than in other more rural regions of British Columbia.",

It is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the temperate rainforests of B.C.'s North Coast Region and the coastal \u201cpanhandle\u201d of southeastern Alaska. While it is the largest development region, encompassing 194,024 square kilometers of land, it is also the least populated; Nechako is home to under 40,000 residents, more than 30% of whom are First Nations. There are few large population centres in the region, except in the far south along Highway 16 (Smithers, Houston, and Burns Lake). The Nechako region is comprised of the Traditional Territories of the Sekani and Kaska Dene in the north and the Dakelh, Wet'suwet'en further south. The land is generally mountainous, with many large lakes and rivers that have sustained a traditional economy and trade system since time immemorial.",

      "sum":"The Region's most densely populated and commercially active areas lie in its southern reaches, located between Prince George and Prince Rupert, with well connected transportation and communication networks. Mining plays a large role in most parts of the Nechako region, with many companies actively exploring for minerals and developing agreements and joint ventures related to mining with First Nations. Agriculture (largely cattle ranching and dairy) plays both a historic and contemporary role in the regional economy. Timber harvesting and lumber production are a very dominant economic force, while a growing outdoor tourism industry is emerging as a result of improved transportation networks allowing access to high quality recreational fishing opportunities, abundant and diverse wildlife, high mountainous terrain for trail development and climbing, swift flowing rivers, and calm lakes. Development corporations\u2014 owned collectively by aligned Nations or by individual First Nations\u2014 are the primary vehicles by which First Nations pursue and advocate for sustainable economic development, and can be explored through the Community Profiles Section of this database. The vast and sparsely populated northern reaches of the Nechako region are home to under 1000 individuals, but contain numerous mining and forestry operations. Both the northern and southern Nechako region can reach international export opportunities via the deep water port in Prince Rupert.",

The Coastal geography is made up of fruitful oceans, vast temperate coastal rainforests, and deep fjords that quickly give way to drier mountainous climates further inland.

The region shares a border with Alberta and the Yukon and is part of the Peace River Basin. It is separated from the northwestern part of the province by the Rocky Mountain Trench. The main population and commercial centres in the region are Fort St. John and Dawson Creek.  Approximately 7% of the region's 68,700 residents are First Nations. With much of the region lying east of the Rockies, the physical geography of the Northeast is distinct from much of the rest of the province: a vast and remote area of foothills, forests, lakes and the Peace River valley.  The eastern region beyond the Rockies is the traditional territory of the Dene Tha' cultural group and further north, the Acho Dene Koe. The mountainous western border of the region is considered traditional Kaska Dena territory.",
      "bgd":"The traditional economy of the Dene Tha' and Acho Dene Koe cultural groups was based on a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering society. The less mountainous nature of the terrain east of the Rockies facilitated relatively easy and efficient movement throughout the territory. Being so far north, the colonial economic influence on the region began later than in the south of the province. In the early twentieth century, numerous regional First Nations signed onto Treaty 8 (drafted originally in 1899), which secured access to and protection of the lands upon the traditional economy was built.",
      "sum":"Similarly to other vast, sparsely-populated regions in B.C., the contemporary Northeastern economy is based on natural resources, particularly natural gas production and coal mining. As of 2016, there were 62 major projects operational in the area with a combined value of over $3.7 billion, most of which are in the oil, gas and mining sectors. Another important industry is utilities, due to the power demand from industrial activity in the region. There are many power-generating projects in the planning stages; these include the proposed $7.9 billion B.C. Hydro Site C project. The Site C dam is poised to contribute to economic growth in the region, but opponents worry about the significant flooding of Peace River Valley it would entail, among other concerns. Other important industries are rooted in the earlier regional economy and continue to be important economic drivers in the region. These include logging, wood products manufacturing and agriculture.",

This area is renowned for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes, and in the south, Canada's only desert terrain. With approximately 545,500 residents, it is the third most populous development region in B.C. after Lower Mainland Southwest and Vancouver Island and Coast. Approximately 3.43% of the Thompson Okanagan regional population are First Nations. The region's moderate climate has, since time immemorial, made it a desirable and fruitful place to live. Its mountains, rivers, large lakes, and fertile valleys comprise the traditional territory of numerous First Nations: towards the region's western border lie the eastern reaches of the Sto:lo territory; in the south central portion of the region lies the traditional territories of the Nlaka'pamux and Okanagan, respectively centred around the Nicola and Okanagan valleys. Further north, towards and beyond Kamloops is traditional Secwepemc territory.",
      "bgd":"The original inhabitants of the Thompson Okanagan region relied heavily on its rivers, valleys and mountain passes, which provided \u201chighways\u201d to access the resources that sustained a productive and organized socioeconomic system. Salmon were fished from the rivers and streams, game was hunted in the forests, mountains and grasslands, and plants and medicines were gathered throughout the territory, all the while supporting a robust system of trade, kinship, and governance between neighbouring nations. The large-scale settler economy was preceded by an early fur-trade and homesteading era. The first large period of non-Indigenous economic growth took the form of a large gold rush in the mid-to-late 1800's. This gold rush attracted a number of Europeans, many of whom immigrated north from the United States, creating an unprecedented demand for goods, services, and land. As agriculture expanded in the fertile region, First Nations were forced off their land where the settler economy deemed necessary.",
      "sum":"Like the southern districts of the Vancouver Island and Coast region, the Thompson-Okanagan's moderate climate and scenic beauty have attracted both tourism and population inflow, especially by retirees, over many years. This, in turn, has brought pension and investment income to the region and stimulated development, construction, and service sector employment. Today, the region's economy is a diverse mix of industries that is predominantly service-based, although its historic industrial base of forestry, mining, and agriculture remains important. The trade sector as well as the health care and social assistance industry are the development region's top two employers, followed by various forms of manufacturing, accommodation and food services. The region has also become an important centre for post-secondary education.",

      "desc":"759,400 The Vancouver Island and Coast region encompasses 84,231 square kilometres of land on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and the central portion of B.C.'s mainland coast from Powell River to just north of Ocean Falls and Bella Coola. This region is known for its temperate climate, unspoiled wilderness and beautiful coastlines. In 2015, the region was home to 793,800 residents, making it the second-most-populated region in B.C. after Lower Mainland Southwest. Nearly half the region's residents reside in Victoria's Capital Regional District, 20% in Nanaimo and another 22% principally in small to medium sized communities in the mid and southeast coast of Vancouver Island. The rest of the region is sparsely populated and largely undeveloped. Many communities in these sparsely populated regions in the northern half of Vancouver Island and the mainland portion of the region are First Nations communities. Approximately 5% (39,300) of the regional population are First Nations. This is the highest absolute First Nations population of any region, although other regions have higher proportional First Nations populations, such as the North Coast, whose 35,300 First Nations residents make up over 60% of the total regional population. The geographically diverse Vancouver Island and Coast region contains mountains, fertile agricultural lands, beaches, ancient rainforests, rivers, fjords, and archipelagos, which make up the traditional territory of many Coast Salish groups:  Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Wuikinuxv, Gwa'sala-\u2018Nakwaxda'xw, and Da'naxda'xw in the northern mainland portion of the region adjacent to Queen Charlotte Sound; Quatsino, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Kwakwak'awakw on north and central Vancouver Island; Ditidaht, Pacheedaht, Saanich, Beecher Bay [Scia'new], Malahat, Nanoose [Snaw-naw-as], Songhees, Sooke [T'sou-ke], and Hul'qumi'num on southern Vancouver Island.",
      "bgd":"Most First Nations in the Vancouver Island and Coast region are linguistically and culturally linked to groups in the Lower Mainland Southwest region \u2014 a result of the high levels of movement of people, goods, and knowledge throughout pre-colonial Salishian economy. The regional economic history is similar to that of the Lower Mainland Southwest region: the naturally bountiful Vancouver Island and Coast region, which supported large Indigenous populations, was the ideal location for settler colonial development. In tandem with the Lower Mainland Southwest, the forestry economy grew, as did the population\u2014 especially in the new British Columbian capital, Victoria.",
      "sum":"Today, the service sector is the region's primary employer. Population growth\u2014 especially from retirees\u2014 attracted by the moderate climate, and tourism activity are the region's primary economic drivers. These drivers generate investment, construction activity, and demand for services. Public administration is also a major employer and economic catalyst in Victoria. An emerging technology sector is providing increasing employment in southern Vancouver Island, with high real estate prices in Vancouver reportedly driving talent to Victoria. The contemporary economy of the mid and north Island and mainland coast is more akin to other, more rural economic regions in BC, with commercial fishing and logging continuing to play a large role in providing local employment. First Nations communities in these regions are economically active in these traditional natural resource sectors, as well as in the tourism and ecotourism industries, which seek to conserve, protect, and showcase the astounding ecological value of the region.",
