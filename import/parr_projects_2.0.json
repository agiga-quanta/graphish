The Elephant Hill fire perimetre includes the Bonaparte River and Deadman River watersheds, including at least 79 km of identified fish-bearing streams and river, known major spawning habitat for Steelhead and Rainbow Trout, and spawning habitat for Coho and Chinook Salmon.  The endangered population of Thompson River Steelhead in the Deadman River was also impacted; while the river mainstem lies outside the fire zone, a significant portion of the watershed has been burnt.\u00a0Recent assessments of this Endangered population suggest that if current rates of decline persist for another three generations, the number of spawning fish will decline to only 37.

Many of the Thompson-Shuswap watersheds have been severely altered by land use activities such as forestry and ranching, as well as by extensive wildfire activity. The alteration of upland and riparian areas in these watersheds has resulted in negative impacts. Many of these salmon-bearing streams have become highly prone to drought, resulting in lower stream flows and warmer water temperatures. These effects can be detrimental to salmonid species at risk such as Coho, Chinook and Sockeye Salmon and Steelhead Trout, as well as other fish species and aquatic life.\n\nBirk Creek is a tributary of Barriere River. Rainbow trout, bull trout, and adult coho salmon have been detected in the lower reaches of Birk Creek. However, fish access is limited to the lower reaches of Birk Creek due to a pair of perched culverts installed on North Barriere Lake Road, approximately 900 m from the confluence with Barriere River. Forestry activities in the headwaters is also a major concern facing Birk Creek. The restoration work planned for Birk Creek was to remove the two perched culverts on the North Barriere Lake Road crossing and replace them with a bridge, improving access to upstream reaches of the stream.",

Additionally, this river supports a population of Fraser Spring 42 Chinook Salmon that, while not a SAR, contributes to the diet of the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale. The number one freshwater threat to both species in this system is the alteration of flow regimes resulting in low flows and high water temperatures. Changes to environmental conditions in recent years have included earlier, stronger spring freshets, followed by long periods of drought in summer and fall.

This water would then be released in times of low flow to provide more favourable habitat for the target SAR.",

      "project_description":"Over the last century, much of the valley bottoms in project sites along the Chilako River, Greer Creek and Murray Creek (all part of the Nechako watershed) have been cleared for agricultural purposes. The forested regions of the entire Nechako region experienced a Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic from 1997 through 2006. Since then, decisions were made to salvage log dead pine in this area, leaving many watersheds extensively harvested to levels at which adverse cumulative effects would be expected in the aquatic ecosystem. In-depth study of historical air photo sequences at several locations and countless field observations have identified extensive reaches of stream with lost or compromised riparian areas. The project will focus on rehabilitating riparian ecosystems in the known spawning reaches of the Chilako River and along a series of spawning reaches in Greer Creek (both tributaries to the Nechako River). An off-channel overwintering pond in the flood plain of Murray Creek (a Chinook salmon nursey stream directly above a Nechako White Sturgeon spawning location) will also create a habitat type that is severely compromised in many of watersheds in this area.",

Waterways within the targeted area have been subjected to impacts by numerous anthropogenic factors which threaten SAR such as Coastrange Sculpin, Salish Sucker, and Sockeye, Chinook, and Coho Salmon. Both the quality and quantity of SAR habitat in this area has been reduced due to infrastructure development, agricultural, and forestry activities, introduction of invasive plant species and the increasing impacts of climate change. Impacts include reduced access to off-channel habitat, declining aquatic water quality, and disruptions of natural systems. Key subset areas within Chilliwack will be identified, assessed, and prioritized for restoration and habitat improvement activities.",

Activities will include stream channel reconstruction, bank stabilization, riparian fencing and in-stream habitat enhancement in key tributaries and riparian areas affecting the Horsefly River. Restoration activities will result in direct benefits to endangered Interior Fraser Coho, Middle Fraser River Spring Chinook, and Quesnel Southern Horsefly Sockeye. In-stream activities will restore juvenile rearing and over-wintering habitat as well as adult spawning habitat. Leveraging established relationships and contributions from area ranchers, as well as Nature Conservancy Canada (NCC), this project will prevent future damage by livestock to riparian areas and work to restore already damaged areas. Livestock fencing will be combined with planting native riparian species to re-establish and naturally strengthen streambanks as well as provide shade to lower water temperatures and stabilization to improve water quality and spawning habitat.",

A rock jetty was constructed through the middle of the estuary in the 1970's to facilitate the development of a shipping terminal. This structure has disrupted freshwater influence in the estuary and isolated rearing habitat from juvenile salmon in the Squamish River. Through a series of breaches and removal of key areas of the jetty, freshwater connection to the estuary will be re-established in order to support the recovery of Squamish River Chinook salmon. There are three main components to this project which include: 1) replacement of culverts on the Squamish Training Dyke to improve fish passage from the Squamish river into the Central Estuary, 2) realignment of the Spit to connect up to Third Avenue just north of the Squamish Terminals to open up the entire south end of the estuary to tidal and river water, expanding key estuarine habitat for juvenile fish, and 3) installation of an intake structure across the CN Spur Line that services the Squamish Terminals.",

Areas of concern are the Gulf Islands where the Chinook salmon populations from the Cowichan/Koksilah River systems are residing, and the nearshores and estuaries utilized by Chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon populations for nurseries, refugia, and metabolic growth within Howe Sound, Burrard, and Sechelt Inlets.

Due to its proximity to the river, it is seasonally inundated when the Fraser River rises during the spring freshet. Chinooks, sockeye, and coho juveniles can sometimes enter the pit during the spring when the river is high, but get stranded when the river recedes and becomes disconnected from the pit. A plan to convert the gravel pit to off channel rearing habitat for juvenile salmon was prepared in 1997, but construction did not occur. The Fraser Valley Watersheds Coalition have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation, local First Nations, other government agencies, and stakeholders to pursue remediation and restoration of the Tom Berry gravel pit so that it becomes productive habitat for fish and wildlife.",

      "project_description":"Royston Wrecks - The eastern shore of Vancouver Island have experienced considerable modification through anthropogenic alterations, such as foreshore hardening, industrial and residential shoreline development and infilling of estuaries. This has resulted in fragmentation and significant loss of the eelgrass, salt marsh, and kelp habitats upon which juvenile salmonids and associated feed organisms rely for protection from predation and a migratory corridor. This project focuses on increasing the connectivity between coastal habitats along 86 km of shoreline on eastern Vancouver Island, from Oyster River to Craig Creek, in order to improve rearing conditions for juvenile salmon as they migrate seaward. The 45 salmon bearing rivers along this section of coast support populations of steelhead, coho, Chinook, pink, and chum salmon, which rely on areas of eelgrass, saltmarsh, and kelp habitats for food production and shelter in the early stages of their life. The project will conduct an inventory of eelgrass, saltmarsh, and kelp habitats and identify sites of habitat loss. Restoration sites will be prioritized and a Coastal Restoration Plan developed. Later phases of the project will implement the restoration projects and monitor them for success.",

Since the cessation of mining activities in 1943, Surf Inlet Dam has been out of service, and is currently privately owned, but not operating. The Dam currently impedes passage of all salmon species to Surf River and Cougar Lake which traditionally hosted a variety of fish stocks including Chinook, coho, and high numbers of sockeye, pink and chum salmon.

      "project_description":"The Lower Fraser estuary has been heavily modified by the historic construction of large in-channel structures such as dikes and jetties, which were installed to improve navigation to the extensive port facilities in the area. While these structures serve their intended purpose, they restrict the lateral flow of the river arms to Sturgeon and Roberts Banks, and discourage the exchange of water and sediment between the rivers and its delta. Natural nutrient, sediment, and biogeochemical processes which support a healthy delta and marsh are not functioning efficiently. Tidal marsh habitats in the Fraser estuary provide productive rearing areas for juvenile salmon, and have been reduced to a fraction of their historic area. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation estuary connectivity project will improve fish access to tidal marsh habitat in the Fraser River South Arm over 4 years by modifying existing jetties and flood control infrastructure that is currently impairing the ability of the area to provide habitat to fish. These activities will directly benefit juvenile chinook and other Pacific salmon species, as well as many other species which rely on the estuary. Better access throughout the Fraser estuary will potentially improve early marine survival for Pacific salmon.",

In addition, impacts associated with climate change (e.g. sea level rise, wetter winters, dryer summers) will further stress habitats, reducing the extent of salt brackish marsh and mudflats currently constrained by dikes and other infrastructure. This project will re-connect previously alienated habitat through dike breaches and improvements to water control structures. Fish access to marsh habitat in the South Arm Marshes by upgrading water control infrastructure on Gunn and Rose Kirkland Islands and breaches in the Kirkland Island Jetty. Marsh habitat currently alienated behind dikes in the Alaksen National Wildlife Area will also be restored. Natural physical processes such as circulation, salinity gradients, and nutrient and estuary sedimentation processes will be restored, ensuring these habitats are more resilient and robust to sea level rise.

Surplus sediment has also infilled estuarine tidal channels, degrading estuarine vegetative rearing habitat, the sedge estuarine benches, and the eelgrass beds.

A rock jetty was constructed through the middle of the estuary in the 1970's to facilitate the development of a shipping terminal. This structure has disrupted freshwater influence in the estuary and isolated rearing habitat from juvenile salmon in the Squamish River. Through a series of breaches and removal of key areas of the jetty, freshwater connection to the estuary will be re-established in order to support the recovery of Squamish River Chinook salmon. There are three main components to this project which include: 1) replacement of culverts on the Squamish Training Dyke to improve fish passage from the Squamish river into the Central Estuary, 2) realignment of the Spit to connect up to Third Avenue just north of the Squamish Terminals to open up the entire south end of the estuary to tidal and river water, expanding key estuarine habitat for juvenile fish, and 3) installation of an intake structure across the CN Spur Line that services the Squamish Terminals.",

Areas of concern are the Gulf Islands where the Chinook salmon populations from the Cowichan/Koksilah River systems are residing, and the nearshores and estuaries utilized by Chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon populations for nurseries, refugia, and metabolic growth within Howe Sound, Burrard, and Sechelt Inlets.

Due to its proximity to the river, it is seasonally inundated when the Fraser River rises during the spring freshet. Chinooks, sockeye, and coho juveniles can sometimes enter the pit during the spring when the river is high, but get stranded when the river recedes and becomes disconnected from the pit. A plan to convert the gravel pit to off channel rearing habitat for juvenile salmon was prepared in 1997, but construction did not occur. The Fraser Valley Watersheds Coalition have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation, local First Nations, other government agencies, and stakeholders to pursue remediation and restoration of the Tom Berry gravel pit so that it becomes productive habitat for fish and wildlife.",

      "project_description":"The Lower Fraser estuary has been heavily modified by the historic construction of large in-channel structures such as dikes and jetties, which were installed to improve navigation to the extensive port facilities in the area. While these structures serve their intended purpose, they restrict the lateral flow of the river arms to Sturgeon and Roberts Banks, and discourage the exchange of water and sediment between the rivers and its delta. Natural nutrient, sediment, and biogeochemical processes which support a healthy delta and marsh are not functioning efficiently. Tidal marsh habitats in the Fraser estuary provide productive rearing areas for juvenile salmon, and have been reduced to a fraction of their historic area. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation estuary connectivity project will improve fish access to tidal marsh habitat in the Fraser River South Arm over 4 years by modifying existing jetties and flood control infrastructure that is currently impairing the ability of the area to provide habitat to fish. These activities will directly benefit juvenile chinook and other Pacific salmon species, as well as many other species which rely on the estuary. Better access throughout the Fraser estuary will potentially improve early marine survival for Pacific salmon.",

This project will re-connect previously alienated habitat through dike breaches and improvements to water control structures. Fish access to marsh habitat in the South Arm Marshes by upgrading water control infrastructure on Gunn and Rose Kirkland Islands and breaches in the Kirkland Island Jetty. Marsh habitat currently alienated behind dikes in the Alaksen National Wildlife Area will also be restored. Natural physical processes such as circulation, salinity gradients, and nutrient and estuary sedimentation processes will be restored, ensuring these habitats are more resilient and robust to sea level rise.

Most habitat degradation in these watersheds is linked to excess sediment delivery to the rivers from slides and roads associated with the historic forest harvest. The imbalance in sediments carried by the rivers has affected both the upper tidal reaches and estuaries through the deposition of excess sediment infilling the adult salmon holding pools and degrading the once prolific Chinook, chum and pink spawning beds. Surplus sediment has also infilled estuarine tidal channels, degrading estuarine vegetative rearing habitat, the sedge estuarine benches, and the eelgrass beds. This project includes three components: 1) restoration of channel connectivity, 2) augmentation of estuarine vegetation, and 3) rehabilitation and enhancement of forage fish habitat.",

Eelgrass meadows are unfortunately also areas of high ecological value, providing critical rearing habitat for forage fish that are prey for others key species. Past log handling activities at these locations have caused serious degradation or even complete destruction of fish habitat. This project will restore marine aquatic habitats impacted at historic log handling facilities to create productive habitat, enhance biodiversity values, and recover traditional use values. The project consists of four main task: 1) develop a long-term Restoration Strategy for marine log handling facilities, 2) build local capacity on Haida Gwaii to implement restoration projects and conduct environmental monitoring, 3) restore critical habitat at historic log handling facilities in Haida Gwaii, 4) monitor and assess the success of the restoration projects. This initiative is one of 24 priorities identified by the Council of Haida Nation.",

Two major watersheds, the Nanaimo and Chase Rivers, plus four creeks, drain an area of 84,000 ha into the estuary. This estuary provides critical habitat to juvenile salmon, particularly Chinook and chum, with three genetically distinct populations of Chinook supported by the Nanaimo River. The estuary has been heavily impacted since the 1850's by urban development, agricultural and industrial activity, including coal mining and forestry. This has led to reduced productivity of tidal marsh habitat, loss of tidal channel habitat, damaged mudflats, and degraded water quality. In partnership with the Snuneymuxw First Nation, this project will remove historic berms, address factors limiting freshwater flow to the eastern estuary, and pursue the reconnection of off-channel wetland habitat.",

Project activities will primarily focus on creating and restoring Chinook and chum salmon rearing and overwintering habitat by addressing four main issues/threats: 1) sloughs and side channels in the Harrison-Chehalis and Nicomen Slough area have been lost through anthropogenic changes, 2) lake outlets have very little gravel replenishment, 3) increased sedimentation from the Norrish and Deroche Creek fans, and 4) significant need to continue developing management efforts for the Lh\u00e1:lt/Harrison-Chehalis Wildlife Management Area and Harrison Salmon Stronghold Strategic Plan.",

A rock jetty was constructed through the middle of the estuary in the 1970's to facilitate the development of a shipping terminal. This structure has disrupted freshwater influence in the estuary and isolated rearing habitat from juvenile salmon in the Squamish River. Through a series of breaches and removal of key areas of the jetty, freshwater connection to the estuary will be re-established in order to support the recovery of Squamish River Chinook salmon. There are three main components to this project which include: 1) replacement of culverts on the Squamish Training Dyke to improve fish passage from the Squamish river into the Central Estuary, 2) realignment of the Spit to connect up to Third Avenue just north of the Squamish Terminals to open up the entire south end of the estuary to tidal and river water, expanding key estuarine habitat for juvenile fish, and 3) installation of an intake structure across the CN Spur Line that services the Squamish Terminals.",

The Cowichan/Koksilah Estuary is the fourth largest estuary on Vancouver Island and has been ranked among the top 10 estuaries in BC for conservation value and habitat restoration potential. This project takes a watershed-based approach to coastal restoration by addressing in river factors directly linked to estuarine processes.  Multiple projects on the Cowichan/Koksilah system will be completed to improve key habitats that are thought to be limiting Chinook productivity, thus extending the benefit to SARA listed Southern Resident Killer Whales, First Nations fisheries, and the Georgia Strait ecosystem. Three components are being undertaken simultaneously with this project: (1) habitat improvement in the Cowichan/Koksilah Estuary, (2) restoring the Cowichan-Koksilah riparian greenway, and (3) Stoltz Bluff sediment remediation.",
      "project_goals":"Mitigate stress on river environments linked to estuary changes and improve connectivity and natural processes in the Cowichan/Koksilah estuary.",

Due to its proximity to the river, it is seasonally inundated when the Fraser River rises during the spring freshet. Chinooks, sockeye, and coho juveniles can sometimes enter the pit during the spring when the river is high, but get stranded when the river recedes and becomes disconnected from the pit. A plan to convert the gravel pit to off channel rearing habitat for juvenile salmon was prepared in 1997, but construction did not occur. The Fraser Valley Watersheds Coalition have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation, local First Nations, other government agencies, and stakeholders to pursue remediation and restoration of the Tom Berry gravel pit so that it becomes productive habitat for fish and wildlife.",

      "project_description":"The Lower Fraser estuary has been heavily modified by the historic construction of large in-channel structures such as dikes and jetties, which were installed to improve navigation to the extensive port facilities in the area. While these structures serve their intended purpose, they restrict the lateral flow of the river arms to Sturgeon and Roberts Banks, and discourage the exchange of water and sediment between the rivers and its delta. Natural nutrient, sediment, and biogeochemical processes which support a healthy delta and marsh are not functioning efficiently. Tidal marsh habitats in the Fraser estuary provide productive rearing areas for juvenile salmon, and have been reduced to a fraction of their historic area. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation estuary connectivity project will improve fish access to tidal marsh habitat in the Fraser River South Arm over 4 years by modifying existing jetties and flood control infrastructure that is currently impairing the ability of the area to provide habitat to fish. These activities will directly benefit juvenile chinook and other Pacific salmon species, as well as many other species which rely on the estuary. Better access throughout the Fraser estuary will potentially improve early marine survival for Pacific salmon.",

The Cowichan/Koksilah Estuary is the fourth largest estuary on Vancouver Island and has been ranked among the top 10 estuaries in BC for conservation value and habitat restoration potential. This project takes a watershed-based approach to coastal restoration by addressing in river factors directly linked to estuarine processes.  Multiple projects on the Cowichan/Koksilah system will be completed to improve key habitats that are thought to be limiting Chinook productivity, thus extending the benefit to SARA listed Southern Resident Killer Whales, First Nations fisheries, and the Georgia Strait ecosystem. Three components are being undertaken simultaneously with this project: (1) habitat improvement in the Cowichan/Koksilah Estuary, (2) restoring the Cowichan-Koksilah riparian greenway, and (3) Stoltz Bluff sediment remediation.",

A Tsleil-Waututh Nation Field technician will be hired to operate the fish fence, transport fish, support brood stock, and carry out the tracking work.

In 2016, Tsleil-Waututh Nation led a fish habitat enhancement project in McCartney Creek which included construction of an off-channel habitat feature, excavation of a gravel bar at the culvert outlet, creation of pool habitat and riparian planting. Maintenance and monitoring including removal of riparian invasive species is required to ensure that the restoration efforts continue to be effective. In the Burrard Inlet, the estuary at the mouth of McCartney Creek is significant as it is the only remaining mudflat on the North Shore not destroyed by development. Part of this unique ecosystem is the remnants of ancient sedge peat deposits. There is evidence to suggest that, in Burrard Inlet, sedge peat deposits are crucial for productive, salmon supporting salt marshes. This rare, valuable habitat is eroding, and is affected by hydrological changes to climate change. The feasibility of marsh restoration will be explored though pilot enhancement transplants and monitoring.",

They identified several areas where fish passage issues, heavy predation due to a lack of cover and lower water levels at certain times of the year reduce the quality and quantity of habitat available to fish. In 2017-18, they will address these issues by breaching or removing beaver dams, adding cover to Mariah Creek and modifying channels to increase water levels.

In 2013, 9 beaver dams were found in the lower two reaches of Tintina Creek which were only allowing sockeye access to approximately 10% of anadromous habitat. This project activity further assessed habitat/flow related issues affecting sockeye spawning potential in Tintina Creek and began the process of restoring channel conditions that enable upstream migration.

This Creek has been seriously impacted by the growth and development of the City, however, it continues to support populations of coho and pink salmon as well as Dolly Varden char and Cutthroat trout. Additionally, a small coho salmon hatchery, operated by DFO with community volunteers, releases fed fry and smolts into the creek annually. A section of the Hayes Creek between the Community Recreational Complex and the entrance to a greenspace called McClymont Park has been heavily modified and severely channelized by the construction of stacked rock and mortar walls. These walls have reached the end of their useful life and are deteriorating rapidly. Without a plan or recommendations, the City of Prince Rupert will likely replace the walls with stacked concrete lock-blocks. A detailed hydrological and biological assessment will allow for the development of restoration design recommendations for the site. These recommendations will address the replacement of the sheer rock wall banks currently in place with more natural bank features and instream changes that could be made to restore the habitat's ability to support spawning and rearing.",

In Year 3 (2017-18), the hydrology program aims to conduct the necessary flow measurement at each hydrometric station in the network. The EFN assessment will focus on investigating site-specific limitations to sockeye spawning and rearing habitat in the Nangeese River and work with the restoration engineer to identify suitable soft restoration structures to enhance complexity and increase the quality and quantity of river-type sockeye spawning and rearing habitat.",

The start of the declines in Lower Babine River sockeye escapement closely coincides with the installation of the adult counting fence in 1945/1946, though it is acknowledge that without pre-fence escapement data with which to compare, it is impossible to determine to what possible extent the adult counting fence structure has contributed towards the Lower Babine River sockeye escapement decline. Data collected by Clarke (1967) indicated that the Babine River adult counting fence created a velocity barrier to fry attempting to swim upstream, assumed to be migrating to Nilkitkwa Lake and/or the North Ann of Babine Lake rearing habitat. A fryway was installed in 1969 in response to observations by Clarke (1967) and was observed to have been successful in enabling upstream fry passage (Cam West, Dave Southgate, personal communication). This fryway was removed during an upgrade to the adult counting fence structure in winter 1992/93. The lack of a fryway since 1993 may be contributing to the decline of the lower and upper Babine River sockeye populations. A temporary fryway will be installed by DFO Real Property, Safety and Security (RPSS) in April 2017 in efforts to recover lower and upper Babine River sockeye populations. The Lake Babine Nation will assess the efficacy of the newly installed fryway at the Babine fence site.",

Historically chum, Chinook, coho, and pink salmon spawned in great numbers throughout the mainstem and side channels of Kleanza Creek. The lower section of Kleanza has been impacted from channelization and highway construction. In recent years this has resulted in the mainstem channel shifting and dewatering a previously productive side channel in the lower reach of Kleanza Creek. A recent site visit revealed subsurface flows near the outlet of the side channel with substrates that provide potential for prime spawning throughout the side channel. Stranding of juvenile salmonids in pools formed during freshet high flows has also been observed in the side channel. Various options to restore flows to the side channel have been considered, however, further investigations to groundwater conditions in the channel are required to finalize a restoration plan. The work done this year will be the foundation of a multi-year project in the area to address issues that have arisen due to the channelization that has occurred since the highway bridge was installed. Project activities will assess the feasibility of re-establishing a productive groundwater fed side channel and/or reconnecting the side channel to Kleanza Creek surface flows for spawning and overwintering of juvenile salmonids.",

Upper Babine sockeye escapement has also shown general though slower rate of decline since approximately 1970. One factor contributing to the escapement decline is the removal of floodplain habitat and shoreline habitat complexity caused by the installation of a concrete abutment on the east bank of the enumeration fence and riprap on the west bank of the enumeration fence. These structures presumably intended to prevent bank erosion at the fence location, has formed a short channelized section of river where river velocities during spring freshet can exceed the velocity threshold for upstream fry movement. In 2017, a temporary fry-way was installed to enable sockeye fry to pass upstream, however, there was a significantly higher number of fry entering the downstream end of the fry-way compared to the number of fry exiting. This project involves three treatments to be assessed in an effort to improve sockeye fry upstream passage to Nilkitkwa Lake rearing habitats. The treatments include: (1) plywood flow deflectors installed upstream of the fry-way, (2) additionally plywood baffles installed further downstream within the temporary fry-way, and (3) combinations of upstream flow deflectors and downstream baffles.",

Some Babine Lake tributaries experience sediment/gravel build up at the confluences due to a combination of lake wave action and downstream movement of material during spring freshet. Wild Babine sockeye escapements and production has been declining more rapidly over the last decade. Ensuring access to wild sockeye spawning streams is, therefore, a high priority for Lake Babine Nation (LBN) The pilot stream access restoration projects will create/improve access to spawning areas that wild sockeye spawners require. This project will involve installing rock and wood weirs in 5 Mile and 9 Mile Creeks, installing a log boom at the mouth of 4 Mile Creek to reduce sediment build up, and training of LBN Fisheries program staff in habitat restoration and project monitoring using drones and on-ground surveys.",

Guichon Creek has coho, Chinook and steelhead stocks that are at risk due to high water temperatures and low water levels. The current irrigation system is a stream-fed, open ditch system with very significant water losses. By switching the current system to a groundwater source, this should significantly decrease the amount of surface water being redirected for irrigation use. This in turn would greatly increase flows in Guichon Creek, positively influencing the water available for spawning and rearing salmon and steelhead. This project will include a study to assess for the feasibility of groundwater wells as a replacement for some or all of the current surface water extraction for irrigation purposes. It will also include the drilling of two 6\" diametre test wells and a flow test of the wells.",

In Year 4 (2018-19), GWA will finalize the rating curves for the five hydrometric stations and initiate on-the-ground restoration procedures in the Nangeese watershed. GWA will conduct the necessary flow measurements to build strong rating curves for the five hydrometric stations established by this project.

In 2016, Tsleil-Waututh Nation led a fish habitat enhancement project in McCartney Creek which included construction of an off-channel habitat feature, excavation of a gravel bar at the culvert outlet, creation of pool habitat and riparian planting. Maintenance and monitoring including removal of riparian invasive species is required to ensure that the restoration efforts continue to be effective. In the Burrard Inlet, the estuary at the mouth of McCartney Creek is significant as it is the only remaining mudflat on the North Shore not destroyed by development. Part of this unique ecosystem is the remnants of ancient sedge peat deposits. There is evidence to suggest that, in Burrard Inlet, sedge peat deposits are crucial for productive, salmon supporting salt marshes. This rare, valuable habitat is eroding, and is affected by hydrological changes to climate change. The feasibility of marsh restoration will be explored though pilot enhancement transplants and monitoring.",

In 2017-18, they will address these issues by breaching or removing beaver dams, adding cover to Mariah Creek and modifying channels to increase water levels.

With the proposed works the goal is to protect fish and wildlife habitat that were significantly impacted when the dams were created in the 1930s. \n\nThis project will remove Clarke Meadows Dam, returning it to a complete wetland, restoring approximately 79,200 square-metre of habitat. This project will also focus on engineering designs for decommissioning of Allendale Dam, which is aimed at restoring stream, riparian and wetland areas of 3,808 square-metre, allowing a sustainable water flow downstream while retaining the recreational fishing area.

      "project_description":"The objective of this multi-year Habitat Stewardship Program (HSP) Prevention Stream project is to evaluate the cumulative risks to freshwater salmon habitats from both human and environmental pressures in the Great Bear Rainforest on British Columbia\u2019s Central Coast. The Great Bear Rainforest is one of the last remnants of functioning rainforest in North America. This rich coastal ecosystem supports over 100 geographically and genetically unique groups of wild salmon populations, called Conservation Units (CUs) under Canada\u2019s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP). Despite its global significance, salmon habitat in the Great Bear Rainforest is faced with the same threats that have depressed and extirpated salmon populations throughout the Pacific Northwest. Pressure from human activities (e.g. logging, road development, and industrial infrastructure) and the impacts of climate change threaten to reduce the quality and quantity of productive freshwater habitat available for spawning and migrating salmon. Declines in salmon abundance in places like Rivers and Smith Inlets and the Atnarko River have already impacted local First Nations\u2019 way of life and ability to practice traditional harvesting. In collaboration with the Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xai\u2019Xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv Nation, as well as representatives from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the BC Ministry of Environment, we will work with local First Nations communities to identify spawning locations for chum (Onchorynchus keta), Chinook (O. kisutch), coho (O. kisutch), sockeye (O. nerka), and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon in the Great Bear Rainforest. We will quantify key pressures on salmon habitat in the region based on available provincial-scale data and local knowledge. By developing a core set of habitat pressure indicators and defined benchmark values we will then be able to identify the habitats at the highest risk of degradation. As a parallel activity, we will be utilizing core stock assessment data to assess the biological status of all salmon CUs in the region. Finally, we will communicate these results to the public, local First nations and resource managers through community visits and workshops, as well as online via the Pacific Salmon Explorer (www.salmonexplorer.ca). These activities will help to address key threats to salmon habitat and result in: (i) a collection of over 50 high-quality data sets related to pressures on freshwater salmon habitats; (ii) a standardized methodology for assessing the risks to salmon habitats that can be adopted by partners and stewardship groups; (iii) a suite of online, interactive maps for over 100 CUs showing low, moderate, or high risk of habitat degradation from individual as well as cumulative pressures; (iv) a suite of maps related to the status of salmon populations (e.g. spawner abundance and run-timing); and (v) coastal communities that support the project and will help support the integration of findings into local conservation and resource planning initiatives.",

      "project_description":"Location 5 - Building upon the success of our 2014-16 project, we aim to pivot from exploratory research to that with direct policy relevance and demonstrable conservation outcomes. We will greatly expand our targeted outreach and education to include more communities on Vancouver Island, other southern Gulf Islands, and the Greater Vancouver Area. We will establish a marquee citizen science experience for the sport dive community at permanent \u201cdestination\u201d dive survey locations around Galiano and Valdes Islands. Data generated will be integrated into international monitoring regimes (e.g. Smithsonian Institution Monitoring and Assessment of Biodiversity (SIMAB) program) while simultaneously increasing public exposure of marine conservation issues. We will begin with rigorous assessments of citizen-science dive survey data, and work with partner organizations and other conservation groups such as REEF and Vancouver Aquarium to leverage recreational divers for monitoring these sites. We will also establish permanent top-side monitoring of dive sites to chronicle human activities relevant to species conservation below water. Thus this project will continue to reinforce the social and ecological importance of RCAs for protecting rockfish populations and their habitats from environmental pressures like recreational fishing. We will engage the broader audience through articles published through peer-reviewed and open access scientific journals. Resources will be methodically dispersed in the community and evaluated for effectiveness. University of Victoria (UVic) student technicians will lead outreach activities in the summer. We will expand shore mounted trail camera monitoring in RCAs and in-person dockside interviews and leverage undergraduate student learning opportunities for analysis. We will offer expert guest lectures and a stakeholder workshop. We aim to engage the hearts and minds of the community, heighten awareness, improve scientific knowledge, and enable action-oriented discussions between diverse stakeholders.",

      "project_description":"This project directly supports the implementation of Strategy Two of Canada\u2019s Wild Salmon Policy in the Skeena watershed. Focusing on the Skeena river estuary, this project will document estuarine habitat characteristics for all five species of Pacific salmon. The Skeena estuary is part of the Chatham Sound Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area located near Prince Rupert, on the north-central coast of British Columbia. Estuaries provide critical habitats for all species of Pacific salmon during the physiologically challenging transition between fresh and salt water. Yet, despite their importance, we have a limited understanding of the locations of high value salmon habitat in the Skeena estuary and their vulnerability to cumulative threats and pressures. This project will improve our understanding of, and identify potential threats to, the status of salmon habitat in the Skeena estuary. Indicators, benchmarks, and a collaborative monitoring framework will be developed to assess the status of salmon habitat over time, and will reflect existing stewardship initiatives and regional monitoring priorities. A unique feature of this project is the establishment of a multi-sectoral Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to provide regional expertise and guidance throughout the duration of the project, including local First Nations, eNGOs, academic researchers, provincial and federal governments, the Prince Rupert Port Authority, and others. The TAC will play a critical role in informing the design of future stewardship activities in the watershed and identifying areas of high value and degraded habitat \u2013 i.e. areas in need of protection and restoration. A TAC is an effective medium for engaging Canadians in the conservation of salmon populations and their habitat and creating active stewards in the watershed.",

Location of the project is South Thompson River upstream, including Shuswap and Mara Lake system and its tributaries, and looking at the four species of anadromous salmon (chinook, chum, pink and sockeye). Habitat types are freshwater systems and their riparian areas, and threats will be documented including human impacts to foreshore and riparian areas and impacts on water quantity, flows and temperature. The main activities for the project will be to update the original overview documents through information provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada staff, First Nations fisheries managers, other stakeholders, restoration projects, Foreshore Inventory and Sensitive Habitat Inventory Monitoring projects completed, equivalent clearcut areas from watershed assessments and/or mountain pine beetle forest cover changes, and other local knowledge on habitat changes. The updated overview will be widely distributed to stewardship groups, all four orders of government (local, First Nations, provincial and federal) and posted on the Fraser Basin Council website, and profiled at our annual stewardship workshop. Activities are to be carried out from April 2015 to March 2016. Anticipated project benefits and outcomes are updated strategic overview of threats to anadromous salmon in the watershed, priorizing of future restoration activities, and documentation of critical local knowledge before key government staff and stewardship group project leaders is lost (i.e., retirement, death, moving away, etc.)",

This proposal examines several aspects of the habitat requirements of Chinook Salmon to explore whether the needs of this species are being met. There are several tasks included. Examine habitat requirements of fall timed migrating adult Chinook Salmon and collection of information on adverse issues associated with drought conditions. Water temperature, water quality, pool depth, riffle depth, presence of pre-spawn mortalities, abnormal location of spawning activities will all be used to assess the effect of drought conditions. Examine habitat requirements of migrating and rearing juvenile Chinook Salmon in lower 10 kilometres of Cowichan River. Recent work indicates that the juvenile ocean-type Chinook are not actually using the \u2018classical\u2019 habitats so additional information is required to identify the additional areas that are important to migrating and rearing juveniles prior to smolting and seaward migration. Examine migrating, holding and spawning habitat requirements for summer timed Chinook Salmon adults and habitat usage of juveniles. The habitat requirements of the summer timed run of Chinook Salmon are poorly known and must be better understood prior to being able to protect this component of the Cowichan River Chinook. The target area, is the freshwater ecosystem of the Cowichan River in British Columbia.",

Location of the project is the South Thompson and Thompson River from the outlet at Little Shuswap Lake to the east end of Kamloops Lake. Target species are the four species of anadromous salmon (chinook, chum, pink and sockeye). Habitat types are freshwater systems and their riparian areas, and threats will be documented including human impacts to foreshore and riparian areas and impacts on water quantity, flows and temperature. The main activities for the project will include detailed analysis and inventory on the river of the status of the foreshore, mapping of that data, and developing the aquatic habitat index. The FIM and AHI results will be posted on the Community Mapping Network website (www.cmnbc.ca), widely distributed to stewardship groups, all four orders of government (local, First Nations, provincial and federal) and posted on the Fraser Basin Council website, and profiled at our annual stewardship workshop. Activities are to be carried out from April 2015 to March 2016.

      "project_description":"This Habitat Stewardship Program (HSP) Prevention Stream project will address the restoration of salmon spawning and rearing areas (previously lost due to channelization in the 1950s) in the Okanagan River. As oceanic fishing pressure and global temperatures rise, the threat of stress caused illness increases and the need for effective available spawning habitat for Okanagan Salmonids becomes increasingly important. Kokanee and Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka: Secure), as well as Steelhead Salmon and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss: Secure) will be benefited by the creation of these habitat features. Funding from this project will be used primarily for conceptual and engineering designs of the salmon spawning beds and habitat features. This leaves the potential design scope and exact location of the habitat features undefined until the final designs are completed, however, previously installed spawning beds in the Penticton channel were approximately 0.4 ha, 0.5 ha and 1 ha. This project's timeline should occur between the April 2016 and March 2017. The project deliverables will be an effective spawning bed design that will allow for minimal disturbance of the riverine and riparian habitat for maximum enhancement of salmon spawning areas. Well engineered designs will allow for more precise heavy equipment use and will minimise the potential for aquatic ecosystem disruption from contaminated or turbid water. The beds already installed at the site were found to contain Froude numbers that are optimised to Sockeye Salmon spawning. Once the designs are approved and this spawning bed is installed, up to 3 km of the Penticton channel will contain these new salmon spawning beds.",

      "project_description":"This project is part of a multi-year projected study on the early and fall run Cowichan Chinook salmon. Aspects of it started in 2015-2016 under the Aboriginal Fund Species at Risk and Habitat Stewardship Program funding and is planned to continue for up to 5 years to establish a strong baseline of data. Very little information is known about the early (spring) run of Chinook to the Cowichan or Koksilah Rivers, such as holding and spawning locations, timing of spawning, habitat and flow requirements for migration, genetic variability from the fall run, run timing parametres, and morphological differences from the fall run. Not knowing the answers to these questions are cause for concern as no protection can be given to this run, hence everything we do could be a threat (i.e. how we manage our river flow, where and when fisheries are open, habitat loss in the riparian zone from diking the main river channel in flood prone areas, etc). The main objectives of this project are to quantify critical habitat for all Chinook life history stages within the rivers including understanding how the low river flows (drought period) may affect the spring and fall runs of Chinook during migration and spawning, and monitoring habitat usage by juvenile Chinook, both early and fall run, in the upper and lower Cowichan River system. The project will also continue to build capacity within Cowichan Tribes to lead this type of work in the future.",

It aligns with overarching program objectives by enabling Canadians to become involved in stewardship of Chinook and will create tangible benefits for this species. This species has been designated as a regional priority. Our organization has been addressing this issue for the last two years through the implementation of a Barkley Chinook Risk Assessment, as well as investigation through the previous year's project (Barkley Chinook Restoration Project funded by HSP with in kind from volunteers). The Barkley Chinook Restoration Project involved volunteers collecting information on tributaries and estuarine utilization. Biologists were hired to design and implement the project. While the Barkley Chinook Restoration Project incorporated both tributary investigation and estuarine investigation, we feel it would be best to separate these two components into an HSP grant focused on tributary habitat restoration, and a Wetlands grant that would focus on estuarine habitat restoration. The work in 2016/17 is directed towards creating prescriptions for the areas of restoration identified in the Overview. We will apply for further funding for Year 2 (2017/18) and Year 3 (2018/19) to focus on implementing the designs and recommendations that have come forward through our previous work including habitat restoration in the tributaries leading to the inlet, fisheries management protocols, enhancement goals, and protection for critical habitat for spawning and rearing. These activities will deliver on all four of the program expected results - important habitat for Chinook will be identified and protected, important habitat for Chinook will be improved to meet their needs, potential threats to Chinook salmon will be identified, stopped, removed or mitigated, and we will engage Canadians, particularly resource users, in activities that prevent species from becoming a conservation concern.",

      "project_description":"The objective of this multi-year Habitat Stewardship Program (HSP) Prevention Stream project is to evaluate the cumulative risks to freshwater salmon habitats from both human and environmental pressures in the Great Bear Rainforest on British Columbia\u2019s Central Coast. The Great Bear Rainforest is one of the last remnants of functioning rainforest in North America. This rich coastal ecosystem supports over 100 geographically and genetically unique groups of wild salmon populations, called Conservation Units (CUs) under Canada\u2019s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP). Despite its global significance, salmon habitat in the Great Bear Rainforest is faced with the same threats that have depressed and extirpated salmon populations throughout the Pacific Northwest. Pressure from human activities (e.g. logging, road development, and industrial infrastructure) and the impacts of climate change threaten to reduce the quality and quantity of productive freshwater habitat available for spawning and migrating salmon. Declines in salmon abundance in places like Rivers and Smith Inlets and the Atnarko River have already impacted local First Nations\u2019 way of life and ability to practice traditional harvesting. In collaboration with the Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xai\u2019Xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv Nation, as well as representatives from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the BC Ministry of Environment, we will work with local First Nations communities to identify spawning locations for chum (Onchorynchus keta), Chinook (O. kisutch), coho (O. kisutch), sockeye (O. nerka), and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon in the Great Bear Rainforest. We will quantify key pressures on salmon habitat in the region based on available provincial-scale data and local knowledge. By developing a core set of habitat pressure indicators and defined benchmark values we will then be able to identify the habitats at the highest risk of degradation. As a parallel activity, we will be utilizing core stock assessment data to assess the biological status of all salmon CUs in the region. Finally, we will communicate these results to the public, local First nations and resource managers through community visits and workshops, as well as online via the Pacific Salmon Explorer (www.salmonexplorer.ca). These activities will help to address key threats to salmon habitat and result in: (i) a collection of over 50 high-quality data sets related to pressures on freshwater salmon habitats; (ii) a standardized methodology for assessing the risks to salmon habitats that can be adopted by partners and stewardship groups; (iii) a suite of online, interactive maps for over 100 CUs showing low, moderate, or high risk of habitat degradation from individual as well as cumulative pressures; (iv) a suite of maps related to the status of salmon populations (e.g. spawner abundance and run-timing); and (v) coastal communities that support the project and will help support the integration of findings into local conservation and resource planning initiatives.",

      "project_description":"This single year Habitat Stewardship Program (HSP) Prevention Stream project has the overall purpose of identifying and reducing the potential effects of marine fishery by-catch on sockeye salmon returning to spawn in the Atnarko River. The Atnarko connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Bella Coola River, British Columbia. The work is needed urgently because Atnarko River sockeye are essential to the food security and cultural integrity of the Nuxalk Nation, yet this stock declined sharply in the mid-1990s and remains depressed. A recent recovery plan (Connors et al. 2016) identified status of Atnarko sockeye as unequivocally in the \u201cred zone\u201d when assessed against Fisheries and Oceans Canada Wild Salmon Policy biological benchmarks. This assessment indicates the need for urgent conservation and management intervention. Our proposed activities are to (1) catalogue and analyse existing tissue samples, currently stored at the DFO Bella Coola office, of sockeye caught in marine fisheries in area 8 (Fitzugh Sound, Burke Channel and vicinity), (2) collect additional tissue samples at the spawning areas (Lonesome Lake, Tenas Lake, and Atrnarko River) to improve the genetic baseline for marine-caught samples, (3) engage the DFO genetics lab in analysing these samples, (4) use the results of the molecular analyses to generate preliminary estimates of stock composition and total Atnarko sockeye harvest in Area 8 fisheries, and to design future field sampling from marine fisheries to improve these estimates, and (5) preliminarily evaluate the impacts of incidental harvest of Atnarko Sockeye on the stock\u2019s prospects for recovery and recommend mitigation measures. These activities will deliver on two of the four expected results under the Habitat Stewardship Program Prevention Stream. First, by analysing fishery bycatch and its potential impediment to the recovery of Atnarko sockeye, we will address \"Potential threats to individual target species, and/or their habitat, caused by human activities are stopped, removed and/or mitigated.\" Second, by working with the Fisheries program of the Nuxalk Nation for the collection of field samples and synthesis of existing data on incidental catches, we will ensure that \"Project benefits are sustained over time by engaging Canadians ...in activities that prevent species from becoming a conservation concern.\" In this case, we will help build capacity within the First Nation most impacted by the decline of Atnarko sockeye and which is most invested in the stock's recovery.",

A primary KSRP goal is the restoration of sockeye salmon in the Coquitlam Reservoir. A critical uncertainty identified for this goal is the feasibility of providing safe and effective downstream passage for smolts from the reservoir to the lower river. Using data from other fish passage facilities and site-specific information, this project will evaluate passage feasibility and develop a concept-level design and cost estimate for a chosen alternative.

Using the new delivery system, approximately 200 cubic-metres of gravel will be added to the first pool tail-out. Based on the 2016 project, costs per-unit of gravel is about 40% of the helicopter method. This gravel will provide valuable spawning habitat for all species of salmon and trout. Also, as more gravel is added to the canyon over time, the habitat will become more gravel rich, increasing the spawning capacity further. Given the infrastructure investment by the FWCP and others, this is a logical step forward in mitigating the gravel recruitment issue in this system.",

The lower reaches of this river lie within Paradise Valley, a highly productive area that has a broad floodplain and numerous side channels.

The project site, the \u201cKiwi Connector Channel & Gorbuscha Channel Complex\u201d is located within the Dave Marshall Salmon Reserve on the properties managed by School District #44\u2019s Cheakamus Center (rebranded from North Vancouver Outdoor School), which is recognized as one of the premier outdoor education facilities in Canada and on Squamish Nation lands at IR 11. This year\u2019s project expanded on the works initiated in 2016/2017. The Kiwi Connector Channel included the construction of a new channel that connected into Kiwi Channel South and now flows across Paradise Valley road via a new culvert alignment. The project also included upgrading the existing culvert crossing across Paradise Valley Road that flowed into Emerald Forest Creek, repairing bridge crossings (two), and placement of boulder clusters and large woody debris (LWD) in the newly constructed stream. On the east side of Paradise Valley Road work continued with the Gorbuscha Channel, also with two new bridge replacements and cleaning out sediment buildup to improve overall downstream flows. The weirs that are controlling the flow were also cleaned and upgraded to better perform their function.",

From 1970\u20131999, next to no water flowed across the dyke as there was only one small culvert that was obstructed with woody debris by the early 1980s. In 1999 the Squamish River Watershed Society, in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, commenced a program to install two, three-metre diametre culverts at key locations along the training dyke to reconnect the Squamish River with the Central Estuary channel and provide tidal flows once again. Currently, many of these culverts are underperforming and are in need of replacement (e.g., Clear Span Bridge).",

By 1972, the \"training dyke\" had been constructed, but the government of the day shut down all future operations. From 1970\u20131999, next to no water flowed across the dyke as there was only one small culvert that was obstructed with woody debris by the early 1980s. In 1999 the Squamish River Watershed Society, in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, commenced a program to install two, three-metre diametre culverts at key locations along the training dyke to reconnect the Squamish River with the Central Estuary channel and provide tidal flows once again. Currently, many of these culverts are underperforming and are in need of replacement (e.g., Clear Span Bridge).",

Based on the 2017 project, costs per-unit of gravel is about 30 per cent of the helicopter method. This gravel will provide valuable spawning habitat for all species of salmon and trout.

This area consists of numerous channels and gravel bars, important for salmon spawning and rearing. There are limited areas remaining on the lower Stave River floodplain that supports significant populations of coho salmon adults and juveniles. This section of the river also provides the only remaining spawning habitat for 500,000 chum and hundreds of coho, pink, and Chinook salmon. In 2007, Fraser Valley Watershed Coalition and partners took actions to create more complex spawning habitat (off-channels) appropriate for the tail-water release flows of the Ruskin Dam. These channels (1 through 5) were anticipated to require management every ten to twenty to ensure gravel and bar movement. This project is part of a continued effort to manage these channels.",

This invasive species has been found on the west coast of Vancouver Island, but has not yet spread to certain parts of the eastern coast of Vancouver Island. In August 2018, the NSWS in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) hosted an Aquatic Science Technician from DFO who helped us perform a survey of C. maenas in the Tahsis River Estuary. We caught over 1700 individuals in 48 traps - an increase from the 3 individuals caught by a similar survey performed in 2010.

Further work will investigate the limiting factors contributing to the decline. This project will support enhancement and coded-wire tagging activities of up to 50,000 yearling smolts. Enhancement will provide the population with a greater smolt survival rate, while the tags will provide much-needed assessment and stock distribution information. (e.g., Clear Span Bridge).",

The project began with assessment, research and restoration on Tranquil Creek in 2016 and will include works on the Bedwell River and Saya Creek from 2019-onward. We are asking for Pacific Salmon Foundation to join in support of this project with funding to assist in the fall 2019 riparian restoration component of this project and for the purchase of a crew boat to access restoration sites. On the west coast of Vancouver Island the majority of our major rivers are accessible by boat only, and a safe and reliable crew boat is the only feasible means of transportation to and from project sites. For the last 25 years our organization has relied on donated boat transport or charters. We have been fortunate to have a number of partners donating transportation to and from project sites over the years, however it is unfair and unsustainable to be asking for donated transportation year after year. Chartering boats is our other option but this takes a significant amount of funding away from the restoration efforts and is often unreliable. A boat purchase is not covered in our current agreements and being able to purchase a boat of our own would free up significant funding currently allocated to chartering boat transport to be instead investing in habitat restoration efforts. While this is a multiyear project, the PSF supported components will be completed in fall/winter 2019.",

      "project_description":"Salwein Creek - This project is part of a multi-year watershed level restoration project to restore salmon spawning, off-channel rearing and over-wintering habitat in the Chilliwack and Vedder River watershed. The Peach Creek Extension Channel is an off-channel habitat to support increased salmon spawning. Lack of gravel recruitment in the upper reaches of the Chilliwack River limits spawning by chinook salmon, steelhead, and other salmonid species in downstream areas. Primary project objectives were to increase viable off-channel habitats to support rearing, overwintering, and spawning salmon, wildlife, and overall biodiversity. Restoration efforts targeted three main project sites: 1) Stewart Creek, 2) Street Creek, and 3) Peach Creek Extension Channel.\n\nStreet Creek is a small creek that flows north and connects to the recently restored Browne Creek Wetlands. At the project site, significant encroachment of reed canary grass and sedimentation has altered accessibility of spawning gravels.",

The Peach Creek Extension Channel is an off-channel habitat to support increased salmon spawning. Lack of gravel recruitment in the upper reaches of the Chilliwack River limits spawning by chinook salmon, steelhead, and other salmonid species in downstream areas. Primary project objectives were to increase viable off-channel habitats to support rearing, overwintering, and spawning salmon, wildlife, and overall biodiversity. Restoration efforts targeted three main project sites: 1) Stewart Creek, 2) Street Creek, and 3) Peach Creek Extension Channel.\n\nStreet Creek is a small creek that flows north and connects to the recently restored Browne Creek Wetlands. At the project site, significant encroachment of reed canary grass and sedimentation has altered accessibility of spawning gravels.",
